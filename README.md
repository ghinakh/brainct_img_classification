This is our final project for the Advanced Intelligent System course. We build a model for the classification of brain tumors, cancers, and aneurysms from brain CT images using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Here, we tried to analyze the effect of learning rate and convolution stride in CNN. We provide the codes and the report for this final project.
